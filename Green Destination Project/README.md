## Objective: 
Green Destination is a well known travel Agency. The HR Director has recently noticed an increase in employees leaving (i.e., Attrition). She would like to figure out any trends or patterns. She has surveyed the staff of Green Destinations and provided the data.

She would like to know what the Attrition Rate is (% of people who have left)

She would also like to know if factors like age, years, at the company and income play a part in determining if people will leave or not.


For which I have made an analysis based on the data provided by the company. 

Open the pivottabeljs.html file after opening the notebook separately in a different tab. You'll get to see a pivot table and can make conclusions out of it your own.
